				<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Marian-Sergiu Nistor: Exercise 1 - RDF model which describes 4 distinct entities (People, Genres, SubGenres, Artists). Each person eiter likes or dislikes an artist, based on its
					personality type and emotional state. An artist can be part of one or more subgenres, while each subgenre can be a subclass of a bigger genre. The technologies used are comprised
					of RDS (Turtle syntax) for mapping the entities and their relationships, SHACL for imposing constraints over the entities. The model makes use of DBO (DBpedia Ontology),
					MO (Music Ontology) and FOAF (Friend-of-a-Friend). The imposed constraints can be found in <i>Exercise1/schema.rdf</i>. The ontology is situatied in <i>Exercise1/ontology.rdf</i>.
					The visual representation of the ontology is represented in <i>Exercise1/graph.png</i>.</li>
