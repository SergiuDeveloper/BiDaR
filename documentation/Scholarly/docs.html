			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>
				The project represents a web application meant to provide our customers with means of querying, comparing, visualising and sharing data retrieved from a dedicated knowledge base, such as Wikidata, based on their preferences.<br>
				The users are prompted to select their needs, preferences and interests from a specific dashboard.
			</p>

			<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
			<p>
				<h3>2.1.System Architecture</h3>
				The system will be comprised of two main components: the UI (and the server that’s handling the UI data display operations) and the underlying REST API (which will query data from various knowledge Web systems like Wikidata).<br>

			<p>
				<h3>2.2. REST API Endpoints</h3>
				<b>Client Profile Management Service</b> will be used for providing UI profile data and for updating user preferences when they are modified. The service will add different relationships between users and preference in the rdf file.<br><br>
				<b>Data processing Service</b> will be responsible with querying and processing data from different endpoints, such as wiidata. This service will also handle the constriction of the sparql queries that will be used to retrieve data and the different operations performed on the data sets, like union, difference, intersection etc.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<h3>2.3. Data Format</h3>
				The data will be retrieved from existing knowledge web systems, such as Wikidata.<br>
				User-related information (e.g. username, hashed password, preferences) will be described in RDF.
			</p>

			<h2>Technologies and External Data Sources Used</h2>
			<p>
				The server that’s handling the UI data display operations will be written using Django, which we’ve opted for due to the ease with which a prototype can be designed (considering that Django is a web framework for Python).
				<br><br>
				As for the REST API, which will handle the data query operations, Flask will be used, for consistency, while we intend to implement the entire project using Python.
				<br><br>
				For managing SPARQL queries, we will use SPARQLWrapper, a wrapper for interfacing SPARQL endpoints (https://rdflib.dev/sparqlwrapper/).
				<br><br>
				Data will be retrieved from public sparql endpoints such as the one provided by  Wikidata (https://query.wikidata.org/sparql).
