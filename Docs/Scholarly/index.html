        <p>
            There are plenty of interesting resources provided by various knowledge Web systems like <a role="doc-biblioref">DBpedia</a>. <a role="doc-biblioref">BiDaR</a>, which stands for "big data retriever", represents a micro-service-based platform
            able to intelligently query, visualize large sets of data and additional resources according to the user's needs and preferences. The platform takes into consideration the user's preferences and entourage. Given a set of areas of interest,
            the platform also provides support for suggesting topics that could be of interest for the user.

        <h2>Data Description</h2>
        <p>
            The data used by BiDaR is either acquired from external sources such as <a role="doc-biblioref">DBpedia</a>, or is queried from the internal ontology. External sources are used for querying data that is supposed to be of interest for the user,
            based on his preferences. The internal data model is used for storing relationships between the user and his areas of interest, location, age, peers, and so on.
